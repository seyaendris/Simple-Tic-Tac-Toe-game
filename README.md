# Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns placing their game pieces (circle and cross) on a 3x3 game board. The objective is to get three of your game pieces in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before the other player does.

## Installation

To use the Tic Tac Toe game, simply download or clone the project repository to your local machine. Then, open the `index.html` file in your web browser.


$ git clone <repository-url>


## Usage

Once you have opened the game in your web browser, you can start playing immediately. The game board will be displayed, and the starting player will be indicated as "circle" on the info display.

To make a move, click on an empty square on the game board. The current player's game piece (circle or cross) will be placed in the selected square. Players take turns until one of them wins by getting three of their game pieces in a row or if there are no more empty squares left, resulting in a draw.

## Features
